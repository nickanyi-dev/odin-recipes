    <h1>Baked to perfection</h1>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a 
        great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish 
        to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. 
        Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
        <p>
            Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his 
            favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been 
            cooking since his college days. Alton's original 
            recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so 
            I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve 
            eight people.
