    <h2>Easy Peasy Noodles</h2>
    <p>This egg noodle recipe is basic and old-fashioned, just like grammy used to make! Try them next time you prepare your favorite soup or stew. Don't forget that fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried! You may use a dough hook attachment on your electric mixer or your hands to knead the pasta dough.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Stir flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, and butter.</li>

<li>Knead dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let rest in a covered bowl for 10 minutes.</li>

<li>On a floured surface, roll dough out to a thickness of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut into desired lengths and shapes.</li>

<li>Allow to air-dry before cooking, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>

<li>Cook noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente, about 5 minutes.
</li>
    </ol>
